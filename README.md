### The Problem
Every cell in your body depends on water, yet many people walk around daily in a state of silent dehydration. What seems like just a forgotten glass of water can lead to fatigue, headaches, poor focus, and even long-term health issues. You may be unintentionally harming your body by simply not drinking enough. That's where Wotter comes in.

### What it does
Wotter is a fun and engaging hydration tracker that helps you stay on top of your daily water intake. Set a personalized hydration goal, log each sip, and watch your progress grow. For every ounce of water you drink, collect shells and redeem them for digital Wotter Bottles.

Stay refreshed, stay motivated, with Wotter.

### How we built it
We built Wotter with Next.js, React, CSS, JavaScript, hand drawn art, and by drinking lots of water! We created custom React components, reactive JavaScript functions, and intuitive and engaging styling.

### Hand Drawn Art
The highlight of our captivating user interface is our hand drawn art. Every background and image on our web app was drawn by hand with great care and detail.
